# Todo

issues, but in a simple txt file

# Visions
- An in game bot that represents the HackRPG server!
  - Also, an in game bot that represents the stream!

# Milestones
- A person can feel the investment in their workspace group patterns
  - consistency in the workspace (all components work)
  - anytime access to any workspace (dynamically booted when needed)
  - workspace flow:
    - persist dynamic app
    - select workspace
    * select app in workspace (maybe we already have this for free)
    - resize app
    - move app
      - register control keys
        - start move
        - stop move (can probably be the same key)
      - have app blit to the screen when moving
      - update the app coordinates
    - name the workspace


# Tasks

## Planned
- (there are too many controls, maybe I need a menu)
- get blender objs rendering textures properly
- exit window mode  (super + e functionality, but zmqapi call)
- create positionable at camera position ("spawn Positionables where I'm at")
- bind click to various commands like screenshot (maybe use mousewheel to scroll through the functions)

### Priority
### Opposite of Priority

# Bugs
- Fix crashes (TBC)
- fix lighting acne (distanced)
- fix lighting distance (it creates a circle pattern (look at the key area))
- fix load app spun around bug
- fix how transparent objects work with apps

# Maybe not bugs
- Add music overlay so that if I listen to copywritten music, stream viewers can listen along to the same music synced with the silent video
- Demo full speed, real time, networked multiplayer, add video link to readme
- Reload dynamically created windows
- Intuitive window repositioning
- VR
- can only display 10 apps concurrently bug
- keep list of unsupported applications

- STACK for hotkey, top of stack is "1".
- implement some sort of gravity

## In Progress

## Done
- Fix the unfocused screen direct draw bug
- controls for player speed in game
- click to focus
- fix the need to press hotkey to focus after app creation sometimes bug (kind of fixed, just use mouse click)
- Enable rearranging of hotkeys
  - proposal 1: swapping system

## Suggested
- add HackMatrix to apt and pacman repos (aur should be simple)
